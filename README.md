# Car rental App
## Objective

- [ ] As a **driver**, I want to reserve a car, so that I can use it when I arrive to the branch office.
- [ ] As a **driver**, I want to check all my reservations, so that I can have a history of my movements
- [ ] As a **branch office**, I want to get and validate an official driver's license, so that the validated driver can have the keys.
